# Watchlist üëÅ

A todo app for movies.
Made with React, Tailwind CSS, and TMDB api
First react app

## to-do list for to-do list

- [ ] **build & release on my marvling.github.io**
  - [ ] look into github releases (may not be required)

- [X] Initial Styling
- [ ] Collapsing manus for InfoCanvas

- [X] (Suggestions.js) write exceptions for when a movie doesnt have a data
  -[ ] May need improving
- [ ] Clean-up: hooks in App.js, hooks in Searchbar.js
- [ ] movieToAdd state in TodoCanvas may be unnecessary

- [X] Implement sidecreen for movie info
  - [X] create another component that appears next to the list (I have no idea)
  - [X] maybe the there needs to be a TodoCanvas.js and SideScreen.js that live in App.js

- [X] format todoData.js so it's compatible with TMDB data

- [X] When clicked on suggestion, the movie info is displayed
  - [X] there is an add button next to the movie name in suggestions
  - [ ] Empty div when the search bar is empty
  - [ ] 'no suggestions' only when search fails

- [ ] Conditional Rendering for when there is no movie poster on TMDB(maybe search wikipedia for poster)

- [ ] When search bar is empty, add movie is clicked, previously added movie is added again
- [ ] First time clicking a checkbox triggers a warning (low priority)
