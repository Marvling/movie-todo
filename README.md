# Watchlist üëÅ

A todo app for movies.
Made with React, Tailwind CSS, and TMDB api

Currently very early on development.
Learing React as I make this

## to-do list for to-do list

- [ ] **release this on my website**

- [ ] Initial Styling
  - [ ] should be clear to click on the name(label component) to bring op the infoCanvas

- [ ] Implement sidecreen for movie info
  - [ ] Turn the \<li> into table or links?
  - [X] create another component that appears next to the list (I have no idea)
    - [X] maybe the there needs to be a TodoCanvas.js and SideScreen.js that live in App.js

- [ ] format todoData.js so it's compatible with TMDB data

- [ ] When clicked on suggestion, the movie info is displayed
  - [ ] there is an add button next to the movie name in suggestions

- [ ] Conditional Rendering for when there is no movie poster on TMDB(maybe search wikipedia for poster)

- [ ] Maybe it's better if there is an add button next to the movie (Suggestions.js)
- [ ] First time clicking a checkbox triggers a warning (low priority)
