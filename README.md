# Watchlist 👁

A todo app for movies.
Made with React, Tailwind CSS, and TMDB api

Currently very early on development.
Learing React as I make this

## to-do list for to-do list

- [ ] **release this on my website**

- [ ] Initial Styling

- [ ] Implement sidecreen for movie info
  - [ ] Turn the \<li> into table or links?
  - [ ] create another component that appears next to the list (I have no idea)
    - may be the there needs to be a TodoCanvas.js and SideScreen.js that live in App.js

- [ ] Save the todo list as a json
  - [ ] format todoData.js so it's compatible with TMDB data
